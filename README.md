<h2> Installation </h2>
Before running the NewsBrief program, make sure you have Python 3.7 or later installed on your system. You can clone this repository using the following command:
<br>
<b><i>git clone https://github.com/your_username/NewsBrief-A-Customizable-and-Automated-News-Aggregator.git</i></b>

<h2> Usage </h2>
To start the NewsBrief program, run the following command:<br>
<b><i> streamlit run main.py </i></b>
<br>
This will start the user interface for NewsBrief in our default web browser.

The main.py file contains all the code for the program, including the Streamlit UI code and the machine learning model. The file is organized into several functions, each of which is responsible for a specific aspect of the program's functionality.

The news_scrape.py file is a sample code file that demonstrates how NewsBrief scrapes news sites to gather information and produce the desired results. You can modify this file to add your own news sources or customize the scraping process to suit your needs.
